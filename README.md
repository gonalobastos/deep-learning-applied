# Applied Deep Learning (APA 2024) ‚Äì Practical Projects üß†üíª

This repository contains the practical assignments developed for the course **Applied Deep Learning (APA)** at the University of Coimbra. The course provides a hands-on introduction to deep learning with a focus on computer vision and robotics applications.

Each assignment explores different deep learning concepts, from classification and feature extraction to reinforcement learning and object detection.

## üß† Assignment Summaries

### üß© [TP1 ‚Äì CNNs and Feature Fusion](./tp1_cnn_fusion_classification)

- Designed and optimized a custom CNN for the CIFAR-10 dataset (3 versions: base, V2, V3).
- Trained **AlexNet** and **MobileNetV2** on **EuroSAT**, using both random initialization and pretrained weights.
- Developed a **Middle Fusion model** combining features from both networks.
- Evaluated performance with accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices.

### üß† [TP2 ‚Äì Autoencoders and YOLOv5](./tp2_autoencoders_yolo)

- Implemented **AE**, **VAE**, and **DAE** on FashionMNIST for image reconstruction and classification.
- Visualized latent spaces and assessed robustness to noise.
- Used encoder bottlenecks as feature extractors for classifiers.
- Trained **YOLOv5s** on a custom KITTI subset, comparing training from scratch and transfer learning.

### ü§ñ [TP3 ‚Äì Deep Reinforcement Learning](./tp3_deep_rl_control)

- Applied DQN, Double DQN and Dueling DQN to control a car in the **CarRacing-v2** environment.
- Used a custom CNN as a Q-network for both continuous and discrete actions.
- Transferred the best-performing model to a **custom mobile robot environment**, evaluating two observation modes: PoseOnly and Pose+Map.
- Designed a custom MLP for low-dimensional state input.
